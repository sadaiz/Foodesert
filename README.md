  Do you recall a time in your life when you didn’t have a car? If so, did you ever have to pick between foods because you could not carry both home? Was taking the bus helpful or was it tedious? When looking into food desserts there is an undeniable connection to it and public transportation. There are many reasons why it can be hard to get healthy food when you don’t have a vehicle. Problems such as long routes, small number of grocery stores, and fear of crime are some of many valid reasons why people find it difficult to get resources. Mapping these patterns in low income communities can help conceptualize the challenges and interventions that can be made.  




# In what communities are food deserts? 

  Many of these urban food deserts have commonalities such as being in areas where there are people of color, undereducated residents, and low income households. I'll be exploring previous mapping projects that deal with food deserts and their impact on social justice for the community they’re mapping. I'll also be adding in my own take on mapping the link between food desserts and public transportation. The overall goal is to redefine food deserts by considering how public transportation plays a role in getting food on the table.

   One mapping project focused on bus accessibility to grocery stores with healthy food options. The project was conducted by the Department of Geography at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. The research was based on the south and western suburbs of Madison, Wisconsin. The study was divided into three parts, public transportation, the food desert, and how they intertwine. They’re intention for GIS was to shorten the distance from people’s homes, to the grocery stores near them to a maximum distance of 0.5 miles overall. Breaking down the walk from home to the bus stop to 0.25 miles, and the walk to the bus stop to go home to 0.25 miles as well.
   
   An interesting aspect of this project was that it showed the progression of how their map came to be. Places were highlighted to show an expansion and others become unhighlighted once new data came to play. What was included were the stores that were studied, and low income areas within and out of the food desserts. Route transfers were not included in this map because they were inconvenient to the commuter and it kept the travel time at a good pace. They also didn’t include restrictions that did not matter to their study such as rivers, highways, and forests. This map only focuses on disadvantaged communities to find the best routes for them to use. I believe that their scoring system to rate the quality of the supermarkets and transportation that was used was a great social justice intervention. It went beyond counting the number of markets around low income communities. It focused on the quality of the POP, if coupons and reduced prices were given, the amount of variety and availability, and how nutritional their food was. Having an extensive criteria for what a good market and bus service is goes beyond having them, it's about having quality versions of them. It emphasizes many social justice values like the right for everyone to have equal access to good health, equal opportunity to have markets close by, and equal economic opportunities.

  Another more recent project is an interactive map to locate food deserts by the USDA. The guide is called the Food Access Research Atlas, and it provides indicators for census tracts to find food access by measuring market accessibility. Atlas maps can be created with data from 2015 and 2019 for food access. Their goal is to gather substantial information so that the maps are ultimately used for research or community planning.The map depicts where in the U.S. there are over 100 housing units in which they do not have a vehicle and their closest market is more than 0.5 miles away. When viewing the map, food deserts seem to be prevalent in rural areas and also inner cities.
  The map does not show how public transportation plays a part in having access to these places. This map can be used in a social justice intervention because it can be a tool to find patterns for more research on food desserts. Community planning can also benefit from viewing this map to see what places need the most attention when it comes to accessing food. This map emphasizes values of equity, opportunity, and health. The people who live within the borders of these food deserts are at risk of their health declining and extreme poverty.

  By learning from these projects, the interventions I want to make go beyond simply mapping out concrete data, I want to tell a story. I want to incorporate how many people from these communities actually use the bus to ride to the grocery store. I will research whether the number of people ride the bus to get food has increased or decreased over the years. I will also use data regarding low income and low access areas and if new bus routes have made an impact in grocery store availability. Many buses and other forms of public transportation are not renovated frequently nor new lines added into the transit system. Therefore by seeing the few that are I can notice if it's made a change. I also will look at data in the detours buses take that can affect accessibility and also the crime rate of both where the grocery stores are and the homes of the people in these food deserts. The reason I want to look into this data is because it is known that buses tend to detour on low income communities compared to other neighborhoods. Not only does this affect wait time it also places many people in unsafe places. Many of the people that commute are women and fear of violence robs many of their right to the city. Limitations I’ll have are finding the data in how many people ride for groceries and whether they feel comfortable riding with their groceries. The place I would like to study is Richmond, California. Food deserts in Richmond are an ongoing issue that needs to be addressed. I will be excluding the neighborhoods in Richmond who have food access, cars, and are middle to high income. I will not be including other environmental factors that are currently hurting the residents of Richmond as it might dilute the cause of the map. Previous efforts have tried to attract more stores to settle in Richmond. I will look into how the problem has become so chronic by viewing mobility and quality of foods in Richmond. I will research policies, other maps, and community surveys to contribute to the end of food deserts in Richmond.
